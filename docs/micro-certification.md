## Overview
Certification processes can build trust and inform decisions.    
Investing lots of resources in the sustainability of a software product is not immediatly visible to users searching for an appropriate tool. Certificates can help to make these investments visible.    
At the same time formal certification processes are resource-intensive (for both ... and ...) and ideally are backed by an institution with a long term perspective/funding. Certificates need to be updated and renewed periodically, as does the certification process itself.    
Mirco-certification with badges can help inform decisions by providing metrics relevant for the evaluation of software sustainability in a readable, consistent and portable form. 
Metrics provided by the badges update automatically; thus including those metrics i.e. in a software registry does not increase maintenance cost dramatically (checks for broken badges might be still a good idea).
Low level badges that simply pass on metrics or information empower users to make an informed decision based on their own weighting of criteria. Other more high level badges like the fair-software badge aggregate different metrics and combine them into a quick overview.
